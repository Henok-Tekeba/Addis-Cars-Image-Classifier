# Addis Cars Image Classifier

A TensorFlow project to classify popular car models seen in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).

## Why this project?
- Learn ML basics hands-on
- Create something useful for the Ethiopian context
- Build an end-to-end portfolio piece

## Current Status
- Dataset: ~60 images per class × 20 car types (collected from public sources)
- Code: Basic structure ready (preprocessing, training, utils)
- Next: Train model, show accuracy, add simple demo

## How to Run (once code is added)
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/Henok-Tekeba/Addis-Cars-Image-Classifier.git`
2. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run preprocessing: `python Preprocess.py`
4. Train model: `python Train.py`

## Future Plans
- Improve accuracy with transfer learning
- Build a simple web app (Streamlit or Flask) to upload photos and get predictions
