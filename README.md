# Addis-Cars Image-Classifier
This image classifier is a ersonal project where I’m collecting a real-world dataset of popular cars in Addis Ababa and training a TensorFlow image classifier. Still a work-in-progress . Part of  learning ML fundamentals and improving the project every day.

Overview

This project aims to build an image classifier that recognizes the most common car models in Addis Ababa.
The dataset is collected manually using a web scraper primarly from google images and Ecommerce sites , and the goal is to train a TensorFlow/Keras model and eventually build a simple application using the trained classifier.
>Current Status

- Dataset collected (approximately 60 images per class for 20 car types)

- Dataset organized into class-specific folders

- Preparing the dataset for training

>Then
Model training and evaluation will follow

A simple API or frontend will be added later

> Purpose of the Project

- To gain hands-on experience with machine learning

- To build a complete end-to-end project

- To create something relevant to the Ethiopian context
